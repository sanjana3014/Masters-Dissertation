# PCOS Detection Using CBAM-Enhanced ResNet50

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Master's dissertation, titled **"Detection of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Using CBAM and ResNet50"**. The project focuses on accurately classifying PCOS and Non-PCOS ultrasound images using a deep learning-based approach enhanced with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module).

## Features
- Preprocessing of three datasets: Kaggle, PCOSGen, and SRM Medical College.
- Integration of datasets and preparation for training and evaluation.
- Custom CBAM-enhanced ResNet50 architecture for classification.
- Visualization of Grad-CAM heatmaps for model interpretability.
- Achieved ~98% test accuracy with minimal overfitting.
